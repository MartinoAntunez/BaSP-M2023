    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>
        Megarocket SA gym was founded in 1995 by a former Olympic athlete named Max Strong. Max had always been
        passionate about fitness and wanted to create a gym that would provide people with a welcoming and inclusive
        environment to pursue their fitness goals.</p>
    <p>
        Over the years, Megarocket SA grew into one of the most popular gyms in the city, with a thriving community of
        members who were passionate about fitness. Max continued to run the gym until he retired in 2020.</p>
